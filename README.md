#Python Trivia Game for Beginners


A simple trivia game written in Python for beginner programmers to practice core concepts.

This project is suitable for Python learners to build their first playable trivia game. Beginners can use the source code to practice concepts like dictionaries, loops, user I/O, string handling and conditionals.

## Description

This program implements a text-based multiple choice trivia game. It stores questions and answers in a dictionary. The player is prompted with random questions, their answer is evaluated, and feedback provided. At the end, the final score is printed.

The code is well-commented for clarity. Beginners can readily understand and customize the source.

Answer prompted questions, and view your score at the end.

## Adding Questions

Add question-answer pairs to the dictionary. The key is the question string, value is answer string.

## Future Ideas

Some ways to expand the trivia game:  

- Add timer or limit for answering
- Allow multiple choice or true/false questions
- Show score after each question
- Implement scoring system and levels

Beginner programmers can use this as a base to build upon and customize with new features. This allows improving Python skills.
